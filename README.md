# Windows 10 Debloat Script

Originally I started from the Windows 10 Decrapifier Script of which you can find more details here - https://community.spiceworks.com/scripts/show/4378-windows-10-decrapifier-18xx-19xx-2xxx


Instructions:

Download stage0.bat to a USB Key

Boot the new machine into Audit Mode from the first screen in OOBE using [ctrl] + [shift] + [F3]

Once in Audit Mode ensure that the machine is connected to the internet and double-click stage0.bat to run it.

The script will reboot multiple times and each time continue running from a run-once registry entry until you get back to OOBE to add a new user.
